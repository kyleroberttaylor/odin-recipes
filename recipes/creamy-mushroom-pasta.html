    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Chef John's Creamy Mushroom Pasta features cooked fettucine pasta covered in beautiful, amazing, smelly mushroom sauce. You can use any pasta you like in this dish, my preference being kraft noodles.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces fettucine pasta</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>3/4 pound fresh white mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li>1/4 pound fresh shiitake mushrooms, stemmed and sliced</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 fluid ounces sherry</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken stock</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh chives</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh tarragon</li>
        <li>9 tablespoons freshly shredded Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, divided</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot with water and add some salt. Bring the pot to a rolling boil. Cook the fettuccine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain but do not rinse pasta; transfer to a large serving bowl and keep warm.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir white and shiitake mushrooms in hot oil with a pinch of salt until liquid from mushrooms evaporates and mushrooms are browned, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir garlic into mushrooms and cook for 1 minute; pour in sherry and cook until wine is nearly evaporated. Stir in chicken stock; season with salt and black pepper. Bring to a simmer, reduce heat, and cook until slightly thickended, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour cream into mushroom mixture, stir to combine, and simmer for 5 minutes. Mixture will foam and thicken slightly.</li>
        <li>Stur thyme, chives, and tarragon into mushroom sauce and turn off heat; mix 1/2 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese into sauce until cheese is melted.</li>
        <li>Pour 1/2 of the mushroom sauce over pasta; toss to coat. Top with remaining mushrooms sauce and 1 tablespoon Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.</li>
    </ol>
